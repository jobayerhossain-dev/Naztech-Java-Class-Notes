### Usage of Package in Java

A package can be used for grouping classes and interfaces together that share a common purpose or concern. It contains all related programs.

### Basic Structure of All Java Program

```java
// Optional package declaration
package com.example.myprogram;

// Import statements (if needed)
import java.util.*;

// Class declaration
public class MyClass {
    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Program statements
        System.out.println("Hello, naztech!");
    }

    // Other methods (if needed)
    // ...
}
```

> **Note:**
> Must have a main method to start executing your program
> Java class file name must be same as class name
> In a single java file, there should be one public or default class
