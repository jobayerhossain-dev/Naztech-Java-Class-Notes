## Introduction to Java Class, Object, and Object-Oriented Principles

Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java
- What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Advantages of OOP

**What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?** Object-Oriented Programming, commonly known as OOP, is a programming paradigm or methodology that organizes and structures code based on real-world objects and their interactions. In OOP, software is designed by modeling it as a collection of objects that represent various entities, both physical and conceptual, within the application's domain. Key concepts of OOP include:

1. **Objects:** These are instances of classes and represent real-world entities. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

2. **Classes:** Classes are blueprint or templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects.

3. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, providing data security.

4. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse.

5. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows different classes to have methods with the same name, but each class provides its implementation.

6. **Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential features. It hides the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts.
