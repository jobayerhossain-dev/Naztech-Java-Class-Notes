### What is Java?
Java is a popular secured object-oriented programming language. It was created by Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1990 but officially released to the public in 1995. Now, it owns Oracle Corporation.


### Java use
- Mobile Applications (specially Android apps)
- Desktop Applications
- Web Applications
- Web Servers 
- Application Servers
- Games
- Database connection and much more.


### Features of Java
1. Platform independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
2. Object-oriented programming
3. Strongly typed language
4. Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)
5. Rich standard library
6. Multithreading and concurrency support
7. Exception handling
8. Security features (sandboxing)
9. Dynamic class loading
10. Robustness and error-checking at compile and runtime.
11. Information processed like bytecode.
12. Contain its all previous version.


### Why Use Java?
- Easy to learn and simple to use.
- Open source and free.
- Secured, fast and powerful.
- Huge community support.
- Most popular and large demand in the current job market.
- Works on different platforms like _Linux, Windows, MacOS, IOS, Android_ etc.
- Smiller to _C++_ and _C#_ and makes easy to switch from other programming languages.
- It is an OOP language which gives a clear structure to program and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.


### Hiererchical View of JVM, JRE, JDK
![Hiererchical View of JVM, JRE, JDK ](diagram.jpg "Syntax")

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
- Ensuring platform independence.
- Runtime engine that executes Java bytecode
- Both interpreter and compiler use.
- Native machine code for execution
- Handling memory and th_reads

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** 
- JRE includes the JVM, libraries, and other runtime components required to run Java applications.
- Not include development tools.

**JDK (Java Development Kit):** 
- Contain JRE, essential libraries and development tools.
- Included compiler, debugger, and other utilities.


### Syntax and Semantics
Syntax = Structure and format of codes.
Semantics = Meaning and behavior of codes.


### Identifiers
All java classes, variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code
